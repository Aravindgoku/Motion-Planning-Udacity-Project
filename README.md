# FCND - 3D Motion Planning
![Quad Image](./misc/enroute.png)



This project is a continuation of the [Backyard Flyer project](https://github.com/Aravindgoku/Backyard-Flyer-Square-Project) where a simple square shaped flight path is executed.


## Follow these instructions to tryout the project:
### Step 1: Download the Simulator
This is a new simulator environment!  

Download the Motion-Planning simulator for this project that's appropriate for your operating system from the [simulator releases respository](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Simulator-Releases/releases).

### Step 2: Set up your Python Environment
If you haven't already, set up your Python environment and get all the relevant packages installed using Anaconda following instructions in [this repository](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

### Step 3: Clone this Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Motion-Planning
```
### Step 4: Test setup
The first task in this project is to test the [solution code](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Motion-Planning/blob/master/backyard_flyer_solution.py) for the Backyard Flyer project in this new simulator. Verify that your Backyard Flyer solution code works as expected and your drone can perform the square flight path in the new simulator. To do this, start the simulator and run the [`backyard_flyer_solution.py`](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Motion-Planning/blob/master/backyard_flyer_solution.py) script.

```sh
source activate fcnd # if you haven't already sourced your Python environment, do so now.
python backyard_flyer_solution.py
```
The quad should take off, fly a square pattern and land, just as in the previous project. If everything functions as expected then you are ready to start work on this project. 

### Step 5: Inspect the relevant files
Once the motion planning is chosen in the simulator, run the following to checkout the project:

```sh
python motion_planning.py
```
